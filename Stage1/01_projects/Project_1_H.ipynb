    "<b>General Advice</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "> In your groups:\n",
    "> - Start by planning your work\n",
    "> - You will need fundamental functions; try to plan what these should do, what arguments they should take, which should have default values (some default values will need research - ask us!), and what they should return. Don't forget to consider speed and the format of the data (float? int? array of floats? should the array be a certain length?...)\n",
    "> - Ask for feedback on your plan to save time\n",
    "> - Document your functions so others can understand / use / modify them\n",
    "> - Build more complex functions using the fundamental functions, this may require you to go back and modify the fundamental functions.\n",
    "> - Some things are suitable for objects (classes), others are not. Speed and accuracy are important.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> When coding a function (unless you have a preferred method):\n",
    "> 1. Plan your code in bullet points / pseudo-code\n",
    "> 2. Template your functions - put comments to say what you want to do\n",
    "> 3. Implement your code step-by-step. Pair programming here is your friend and will catch many mistakes, as well as give 2 people enough experience of the code to help debug it\n",
    "> 4. Test your code and document the testing\n",
    "> 5. Provide standard tests <b>only if requested by Haroon/Esher</b> (define an input with a known output and assert that it is the same, or within a tolerance)    \n",
    "> 6. Provide examples of use for each use case (different behaviour with optional arguments etc)\n",
    "> 7. Turn your functions into objects if suitable\n",
    "> 8. Get feedback from peers / supervisors / team-mates / users\n",
    "\n",
    "> - <b> Make a repository to hold your group project</b> (public so we can all access it at need), try to keep this well organised and easy to navigate / use / find something\n",
    "> - Make a Jupyter notebook for each investigation / function / method: such that future users (perhaps you) can use these notebooks to construct the code required to make future GUIs work\n",
    "> - Feel free to store individual work on your own 'dump' repository, and copy completed work to your group repository\n",

    "- [ ] Function to make a figure, with default arguments for parameters such as figure size and other useful features (ask us) including subplots - axes can be handled separately, consider only the figure parameters here\n",
    "- [ ] Function to handle a matplotlib axis; axes are objects and can be passed around by functions. In this function you should define axes labels, limits, grids, legends, and plot data\n",
    "- [ ] Function to handle a secondary y-axis (matplotlib twinx: https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.twinx.html) and do the same as above\n",

    "- [ ] Function to plot cumulative data over time\n",
    "    - [ ] data: x = real time in seconds, y = single value (e.g. a BLM signal summed) changing at 1 Hz (keep all previous data and keep increasing the x axis length)\n",
    "    - [ ] add functionality to plot an envelope/errorbar around the data at +/- 1%\n",
